# My Dog Nessa

## About
The site was created as a mini project when doing a bootcamp via Gateshead College. It involves the use of HTML/CSS & Bootstrap. My intention with the site was to showcase my dog, Nessa, who was been with us for a year and a half now.

I wanted to show pictures of my dog and a little information about her.

I hadn't started using Git at this point so there is no version control/history employed(which explains the lack of commits).
